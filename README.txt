This is my personal website. Although I enjoy doing alot of computer-related activities, website design is not my strength.
With that being said I DID NOT DESIGN THIS WEBSITE! I used this template: https://freehtml5.co/profile-free-html5-bootstrap-template-for-personal-and-vcard-resume-websites/
I did however, add/subtracted enough html code that I feel comfortable calling this project my own.
The following lines where put here by the creater of the template.

TITLE:
